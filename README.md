## Problem  

Uncertainty about fit and appearance is a major concern for online shoppers, leading to:  
- **High return rates** (ranging from 15% to 30%, according to the National Retail Federation).  
- **Reduced sales** (75% of online shoppers abandon purchases due to fit concerns, as found by BodyBlock AI).  

This challenge creates frustration for shoppers and operational strain for retailers, who face increased costs
due to frequent returns and lost sales opportunities. Current solutions like static sizing charts and limited fit
guidance often fail to meet user needs, highlighting the need for a more **accurate, flexible, and user-friendly solution**.

**FitCheckr** is an online shopping plugin that helps reduce fit-related uncertainty for online shoppers by providing
accurate and personalized size recommendations through the use of **avatars** and **detailed size fits**.  

### The plugin will:  
✔️ Integrate with e-commerce platforms on **desktop and mobile**.  
✔️ Allow users to **create personalized avatars** from body measurements.  
✔️ Provide **size recommendations** using **brand-specific** data.  
✔️ Offer **avatar previews, saved profiles, and cross-platform support**.
